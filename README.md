Creating a CSV file for instagram hashtag: "natural"

Just a quick solution due to lack of time.

Just run composer and than call the page via command line or browser.
```
composer install
php index.php
```
If you have the correct file permissions CSV file should be created with this name:
```
instagram_natural.csv
```
Thanks!
